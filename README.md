# Flow Direction

Designing a novel algorithm to transfer streamflow direction from fine scale DEM to a coarse scale grid for routing surface water runoff in a hydrological model

> A note about __Branch organization__: 
> * `main` branch is where the final flow direction project files go in. 
> * `dev` branch is where the flow direction project is developed.
> * `general` branch is where any other assignments, unrelated to the final project are uploaded.
